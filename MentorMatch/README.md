### MentorMatch
# Jan 2020 â€“ May 2020

Project descriptionThis project developed the backend framework for a Northeastern student's venture idea. Mentor Match is a website that high school students can use to help them through the college process by matching them up with an alumnus from their high school, preferably one in college or recently out of college.

This project was unique in that the client came to Generate with a static website fully designed, and was looking for a backend framework to support it. Because the project was further along in its development lifecycle than most Generate clients, our team got to focus more on designing a scalable infrastructure to support the needs of a growing user base.

The bulk of the project was designing a GraphQL API and a PostgreSQL database to store user and school information. The project also included developing a front end framework using React. The backend support for the API was developed using Express JS
