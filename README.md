# Intro
My name is Thomas Keith. I am a computer science and engineering student at Northeastern Unversity, and these are the various engineering and software projects I have worked on during my time at Northeastern. Most of these projects were collaborative projects carried out for clients of Northeastern's student led product development studio, [Generate](https://web.northeastern.edu/generate/). 

Because the work was funded by Northeastern, and contracted through Generate, some of the details must remain private to protect the interest of the clients who own the companies and ventures that I worked on.
