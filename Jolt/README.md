# Jolt
### Sep 2018 â€“ Dec 2018

This project developed the first prototype for a Northeastern student's venture idea, Jolt. Jolt looks similar to most wearable activity trackers, with one major twist - it has the ability to send small, controlled electric shocks through your wrist as an alarm clock. This idea originated when our client shared a dorm room with a very sensitive sleeper, and wanted a way to avoid a loud morning alarm, but maintain the guarantee that it would wake him up.

The scope of this project included programming an AtTiny84 microcontroller to send the shock, designing a PCB to hold the shocking mechanism and the MCU, and 3D printing a housing and wrist band for the device.
