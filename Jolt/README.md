# Malaria Free World
### Jan 2018 â€“ May 2018

This project developed a proof of concept website for a Northeastern student's venture idea. The website served as an educational tool for use in third world countries which are severely affected by Malaria to this day.

The bulk of the project was designing and developing interactive experiments through the web application which would teach the user about malaria prevention methods in their communities while walking them through the scientific process.

The code base used a framework called Django, which is designed to write web applications that integrate Pyhton, JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
